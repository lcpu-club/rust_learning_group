//! Run a "Hello, world!" program.

/// 1. Choose a directory on the computer to hold your project.
/// 2. `cd` to that directory and run `cargo init`.
/// 3. Use your favorite editor or IDE to open the source file located
/// at `./src/main.rs`. (All editors and IDEs are the best editor/IDE
/// on the world!)
/// 4. Write a main function with only one line of code:
///
/// ```no_run
/// println!("Hello, world!");
/// ```
///
/// 5. Run command `cargo build` to compile your source code.
/// 6. Run command `cargo run` to actually run your program.
/// 7. Expect "Hello, world!" to be shown.
fn main() {
    todo!() // Paste code and complete it!
